Hi there 👋


**LucasKelbes/LucasKelbes** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

👋 Hey, I'm Lucas Kelbe, a high school junior from Bloomington, Illinois attending Normal Community Highschool. I split my time study and coding for fun.

💻 My coding expertise includes Java, Flutter, and XML. I've got a soft spot for 'groupit,' my Android-only social media app. It's a wild ride of security, databases, and online user wrangling. You'll also find my contributions on Fitbit apps and clockfaces under CodeboyApps.

🚀 I'm all about app development and the tech horizon. Right now, focusing my career on CS is my main priority through school. 

📚 When I'm not writing code, I'm getting deep into study sessions and hanging out with friends.
