### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**LucasKelbes/LucasKelbes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Lucas Kelbe, a high school junior from Bloomington, Illinois attending Normal Community Highschool. I split my time study and coding for fun.

ğŸ’» My coding expertise includes Java, Flutter, and XML. I've got a soft spot for 'groupit,' my Android-only social media app. It's a wild ride of security, databases, and online user wrangling. You'll also find my contributions on Fitbit apps and clockfaces under CodeboyApps.

ğŸš€ I'm all about app development and the tech horizon. Right now, focusing my career on CS is my main priority through school. 

ğŸ“š When I'm not writing code, I'm getting deep into study sessions and hanging out with friends.

ğŸ”— Find me on GitHub: [LucasKelbes](https://github.com/LucasKelbes)
